Purpose of the Maxims

The Maxim Document is fashioned to achieve two primary purposes:

Strategic Cohesion & Implementation Readiness
To serve as a unified, self contained, airtight, self-referencing compendium of all intellectual, strategic, narrative and infrastructural architectures I have conceived—organized across phases, quarters and systems. This document is designed for rapid deployment, internal continuity, and top-down oversight of all core entities, including but not limited to: Rogueborn, Omnia, TFW Group, ANIMA Studios, the Eternaverse and their associated narrative universes.


Legal Fortification & Administrative Proof of Competency
To withstand legal scrutiny as a foundational artifact of intent, authorship, competency and pre-established infrastructure. It operates as a multipurpose legal instrument:
- Demonstrating copyright origin and IP ownership.
- Articulating my administrative capacity and my leadership competency.
- Providing the legal system with a pre-executed framework detailing how I will manage my estate, capital redirection, IP portfolio and operational control post-clarification of estate.
- Establishing a clear chain of authorship, intent, and execution prior to asset, estate or otherwise related clarifications or public launch.

Additionally, this document WILL also be recognized as an informal clarification of operational sovereignty and personal fiduciary competency, compiled for proactive legal visibility and accountability. It is not merely a documentation of intent—it is a living blueprint of command, self-governance and multi-system orchestration under trust.




World Unveiling Maxim (Schedule A)

Purpose: 
In the near future, these works I will be directing my attention and energy toward, being hereafter referred to as the primary “Flagships” that allow me, Rogueborn and other associated legal and trust instruments to guide others through an expansive narrative universe meant to reforge the entertainment industry from the ground up. This Schedule is split into the following sectors:






High Concept World Strategem


Basic Description & Analysis:

The purpose of this stratagem is to clearly articulate the philosophical structure, genre fusion, medium tethering and narrative proliferation potential of each of the expansive High Concept Worlds developed under the Maxim Document. These are not simply creative IPs, but multi-phase mythoarchitectural networks with integrated internal logic, emotional gravity well and internal social resonance. Each world is a reality-infused myth—one that hacks the psychological firmware of readers, not just entertains. The High Concept World Strategem defines how each world interfaces with the meta-narrative agenda: to reclaim meaning, destroy spiritual amnesia/anethesia and awaken god-coded memory through art.

Detail:

Eternava: Kizamari		“Myth masquerading as urban fantasy”
Narrative Identity:
A transmedia, transgenre narrative that blends dark urban spiritualism, multicosmic metaphysics and existential character intimacy into a soul refining epic. Set in a world post-collapse where remnants of Five World Powers (and an additional Sovereign Country) vie for dominance, both spiritual and ideological.

Core Systems:
Seiryoku, Hanten, Jun, Inga (energy manipulation as ideological warfare), Special Grades (characters as metaphysical singularities), Spectral War (Entanglement Over Eternity, Past & Future interwoven through trauma, growth, recession, and completion).

Thematic Anchor:
Suffering as transmutation. Death as awakening. Power as intimacy and inner discovery.

High Concept Uniqueness: Combines psychological psychodrama with cosmic scale stakes. Inspired by anime (e.g. Tokyo Ghoul, Made in Abyss, Re:Zero) but uniquely structured around emotional consequences of spiritual war rather than battles alone.

Planned Mediums: Manga, Anime, Light Novels, Games, Companion Material, Short Stories, Interactive Lore Sites.

Long-Term Scaling Potential: Capable of spawning alternate subseries in alternate worldlines, spinoffs, prequels, metaphysical expansions.


Project: Resonance		“When Memory Becomes Force, Pain Becomes God.”
Narrative Identity: A quantum metaphysical system driven by Resonance—the force of attunement and soul memory. Centers around Kurosu and the Evyrians, a race trapped in a pataphysical quanta lock in the Rift of Imagination.

Core Systems: Resonance / Perfect Resonace / Herrscher / Requiem. Multiversal Fragmentation and Reconciliation via narrative conflict.

Thematic Anchor: Memory is reality. Narrative friction is spiritual combustion. Those who forget their pain are ruled by it. Those who remember rewrite divinity.

High Concept Uniqueness: Explores narrative warfare where memory, story and trauma collide to form metaphysical weapons. Each battle is simultaneously an existential revelation. Soul hacking and timeline overwriting form the basis of power.

Planned Mediums: Illustrated Novels, Animated Short Films, Visual Story Codex, Limited Animation Series

Long Term Scaling Potential: Fully modular multiverse narrative, able to interface with any other high concept world due to Resonance or Fragmented Realities. Highly suited for crossovers, collaborative expansion and reality bending philosophical exposition.


World Of Ties 		“The very bonds that bind you are your greatest salvation and the noose to your demise”

Narrative Identity: A multinode interconnected multiverse intervention epic centered against an antigod known as the Eschasty (known previously as the Many), which makes ontology bleed and the rise of humanity’s vestiges to excise it, whether they be sinners, heroes or some unconventional in between.

Core Systems: Ontology; otherwise dependent on the specific series.

Thematic Anchor: Inversion of God. Narrative Reclamation. 

High Concept Uniqueness: Interlinked but often unconnected arcs with ultimate, immediate stakes. Inversion of god and interpersonal, divine and self-warfare. Rejection of false / non-benign gods, salvation as chains to destruction, and apoptosis.

Planned Mediums: Novels, Novella, Light Novels, Audiobooks, Anime Mini-series, Live-Action

Long Term Scaling Potential: Multiple self-contained (mostly) narratives with their own systems, spin-offs, one shots, and metaphysical expansions.


Thirteen Realms		“Defying Fate to forge the impossible one”
Narrative Identity: A multi-structural epic centered around inevitability, sleeping gods and trying to save a dying world, narratively focusing on Zekaito and Mordecai, two parts of one whole, both challenging the scripts handed to them and forging a new identity out of the dust. Set in a post-war multiverse where the residue of the Imaginary Demon’s influence struggles to lay dormant. 

Core Systems: Provinces, Voodoo, Realms, Magic, Sorcery.

Thematic Anchor: Refusal as metamorphosis. Darkness as power. True awakening as cataclysm.

High Concept Uniqueness: Explores identity warfare and the use of one’s inner darkness as a necessary crucible for growth and self-weaponization / self-actualization, as well as the consequences of awakening in a world designed to keep you slumbering.

Planned Mediums: Novels, Limited Time Animation Series, Anime Mini Series, Spin Offs, interactive lore sites, games, in-universe companion series, Prequels.

Long Term Scaling Potential: Fully explorable narrative multiverse with dense history, spinoff potential, Mid-Series Expansions (similar to Star Wars’ Canon).


My Little Daemon		“Weight of grief that destroys the world.”
Narrative Identity: A self-contained “historical” fantasy exploring the consequences of burying the world behind a veil, redacting real history and the mass fallout it leaves—especially by those willing to do anything to get it back. Set in a world where imagination can become reality and spirits known as the Daemon lie beyond the senses.

Core Systems: Daemons, Id Factor, X Factor, Reality Scripting, History War.

Thematic Anchor: Writing as memory, control as love, names as power, stories as authorship over reality, live for yourself and not others.

High Concept Uniqueness: Turns psychospiritual misalignment as both power and downfall, frames the villain as protagonist, and displays what occurs after a betrayal of the world. Ambition without ethics leads to spiritual self-poisoning, as this story explores.

Planned Mediums: Novels, Novellas, mini-series + potential light novels.


The Human Experiment		“What is a human, truly?”
Narrative Identity: The most expansive worldbuilding narrative project besides Kizamari and its subsequent works, a gritty sci-fi fantasy realism super narrative centering on the human race during the collapse of the Firmament (Earth) and journey into the lands beyond the Ice Walls while being hunted by alien gods hungry for the ancient god code locked in their DNA.

Core Systems: Preternatura, Mythology, Technology.

Thematic Anchor: Fantasy Induction, what if everything was true? 

High Concept Uniqueness: Taking all conspiracy and enmeshing it in a highly grounded, cohesive manner designed to challenge people’s belief on the subject with intense stakes and gritty realism, uniquely structured around uplifting man’s self-perception. Varied stor POVs create a rich and enticing story.

Planned Mediums: Interactive Lore Visual Codex, Movies, Novels, Spin-offs, Mini Series, Limited Animated Films

Long Term Scaling Potential: Expansive universe with heavy expandability into many creative and artistic directions, cinematic universe potential.


Heathen Gods		“What if we were all gods?”
Narrative Identity: Explores the thematic inverse of the Human Experiment where instead of being in a world with gods, the characters are the gods over the world where gods are the people and live amongst them.

Core Systems: Boons, Domain, Law Of Nature, Equivalent Exchange.

Thematic Anchor: Worship as slavery, power as sacrifice, heritage.

High Concept Uniqueness: A multi expansive lattice of a universe of self-relational gods coexisting and warfare over the boons of the world and the people in it.

Planned Mediums: Books, Animation, Spin-Offs, Mini Series, Movies, Show, Games, Expansions.

Long Term Scaling Potential: Very open, adaptable, animatable universe, comics, extremely simple template that can mimic the superhero comic models of the past or higher cognitive shows similar to DC’s Lucifer or Supernatural. 

World Rollout Strategem


Basic Description & Analysis:

The purpose of this particular is to clearly articulate and detail the general method as to which these High-Concept Worlds described in the High-Concept World Strategem will be systematically deployed to ensure maximum efficacy and maximize the impact of each narrative universe while providing low-barrier entry. This allows deceptive explosive growth and retention for the launch of each Flagship. This system is designed to generate compounding audience growth through casual exposure, multi-stage loops and converting that into long-term participation and early adoption of Flagship narratives. 

Detail:

Growth-Retention Framework

Rung 1 - Core Content
Episodic short story mini-series linked to the main/flagship series, for example, Paranormal Eulogies (episodic horror/spiritual mystery mini-series) in a high-tension, self-contained stories requiring no prior lore knowledge, establishes [Rogueborn’s] narrative quality and world-building depth. Introduces recurring symbols, mechanics and artifacts cross seeding into the larger core series.

Rung 2 - Retention Funnel
Community platforms such as Discord, Fable Connect or an email newsletter. Integrate interactive hooks, such as “artifacts” from cases, such as the Chesire Cat/Piano, and assign personal, evolving roles & symbols. It converts casual readers into community members with identity roles, rewards ongoing participation with exclusive content drops, and builds habit loops through consistent cadence (weekly releases + periodic live events). Progression systems are tailored to the specific mini-series and it’s participation.

Rung 3 - Cultural Infiltration
Weaponizes media payloads, short-form videos (10-60 secs) highlighting iconic moments from the mini-series, “found footage”-style images and audio logs, in-character social accounts (“Paranormal Bureau”), posting artifacts and case teasers. This introduces the world organically into social media spaces without appearing as overt marketing, leverages curiosity gaps and asymmetric information to draw new users to Rung 1. It also encourages fans to publicly share their assigned artifacts/symbols, creating peer-to-peer discovery loops.

Standard Operating Procedures Maxim (Schedule B)



Basic Description & Analysis: 
The Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) Schedule within the Maxim Document details the strategic and actionable core of what the entities (e.g. Rogueborn, Omnia, Eternava, etc.) derive their base framework from and how it gives us the competitive edge— in identity, audience, attention and long term user growth & sustainability. This framework applies to all public-facing/interacting modules and capitalizes on ideas that will allow us to dominate the market of entertainment from the jump. These core tenets and relational values must be upheld to ensure quality of product and self-longevity in comparison to self-cannibilizing industry giants.

Core Non-Negotiable Tenets

Story Is Sacred Reality:
Story is the secret architect of our world… and others as well. There is no better way to breathe life into a story than treating it as if it exists. Become as immersed in the world behind the story as readers in the story, and the characters will tell you how to write the story; it practically tells itself. Mythologize everything you do, treat it as sacred canon, as myth has memory, and its value flows through belief.

Ambition Is Greatness:
Ambition forged through ethics is an indomitable force. We at Rogueborn/Omnia are that indomitable force. We cultivate in ourselves and in others the spirit to turn the impossible into a miracle, to turn dreams into reality. A healthy, competitive ambition is the core of everything we do and everything we are, allowing us to provide the best of quality and bounce back, elastic, when facing setback and disappointment. This trait is a necessity for those in our core team.

Nakama Is Vital:
Nakama, the Japanese concept for “found family” is essential to our culture. We come from all different walks of life, faced with challenges and trials that made us different from one another, and here, we are all family. We strive to embrace and welcome everyone who saw themselves in the story or found a home in them. We treat eachother with love, respect, reverence and truth. This lets everyone show their strengths and shine in synergy, and we defend our Nakama.

Audience Are Participants:
You are the guide, they, the tourists. Show them your world. Immerse them within it, give them a place to belong. The impact on them you could never imagine, so it is our code to treat our audience as participants in exploring our myth. It is our due diligence to invite them into worlds they can find homes they’ve never had, and heal—not escape. A return, a confrontation, an understanding, an integration, a love. All at once.

Reverence, Ritual & Recieving:
We at Rogueborn, Omnia, TFW Group and related companies are eternally grateful for the support of those who participate in our rich ecosystem. That is why we vow to treat everything we interact with as ritual, with reverence, and as though we are receiving, because we are. Everything that comes, does so for a reason, and so we bake that receiving culture into everything we do. Everything is an opportunity to be treated with reverence, ritual and a receiving mindset.







Generational Trading System 

Basic Description & Analysis:
We observe within this particular the weaponization of trading culture, collector mindset, FOMO (fear of missing out) tendencies, prestige and scarcity psychological models and their effects to innovate the primary system as to which stories are told in a cohesive system that will cultivate die-hard fans, exponentially growing the community around flagship series. Together with the ``Indi-Seller Logos``, we introduce the framework that serves as the spine of the New Era Of Storytelling, the backbone that will create cult obsession with the flagship in question.

Detail:

— Echelon 1:

The Generational Distribution System makes up the first echelon of this particular. It is necessary to explain certain aspects of this before we continue. The GDS (Generational Distribution System) is modeled specifically to cut costs and capitalize on the scarcity tendencies by always selling less than demand, significantly reducing costs. These prints run in “Generations”, each generation degrading the premium content before going out of print permanently, creating immense resale potential. For example, the Sovereign Edition is the first ever print of the book, then we reduce the quality of each next edition. It is as follows:

Sovereign Edition: (Signed, Unsealed, Seasonal, Sovereign); Character Bios, Fun Facts, Extra Full Color Art, Author AMAs, accompanying guidebooks, Fate (in-system currency), free memberships, world fun facts expansion, digital markers/NFTs, Funko Pops, additional Merch, redeemable tickets, posters. Complete full color art. [COMES WITH 3 CARDS, REFERENCE THE ETERNAVA TCG™].

Signed = Signed by the author. Unsealed = Essentially a unit that promises extreme digital perks in the website/app hosted by Rogueborn, as opposed to “Sealed” which does not have the same, varied, benefits. Seasonal = Comes equipped with seasonal art and a cover. Sovereign = Name of the edition.

Collector’s Edition: (Unsigned, Unsealed, Seasonal, Collector’s); Character Bios, Fun Facts, Extra Full Color Art, Author AMAs, accompanying guidebooks, Fate (in-system currency), free memberships, world fun facts expansion, digital markers/NFTs, and one additional merch item. Full color splash pages, partial color similar to Bocci The Rock. [COMES WITH 1 CARD FROM ITS RELATED POOL, REFERENCE THE ETERNAVA TCG™].

Limited Edition: (Unsigned, 60% Unsealed, Seasonal, Limited); Character Bios, Fun Facts, Extra Full Color Art, Author AMAs, accompanying guidebooks, Fate (in-system currency), free memberships, world fun facts expansion, partial color similar to Bocci The Rock. [COMES WITH 1 CARD FROM ITS RELATED POOL, REFERENCE THE ETERNAVA TCG™].

Generation 1: (Unsigned, 90% Sealed, Seasonal); Character Bios, Fun Facts, Author AMAs/bios, limited membership, World Fun Facts Expansion, Fate (in-system currency). Possibly really budgeted partial color hues. [COMES WITH 1 CARD FROM ITS RELATED POOL, REFERENCE THE ETERNAVA TCG™].


Generation 2: (Unsigned, 95% Sealed); Fun Facts, Author AMAs/Bios, limited membership, World Fun Facts Expansion, Fate (in-system currency). [COMES WITH 1 CARD FROM ITS RELATED POOL, REFERENCE THE ETERNAVA TCG™].

Generation 3: (Unsigned, 99.6% Sealed); Fun Facts, Author AMAs per volume, World Fun Facts Expansion, Fate (in-system currency). [COMES WITH 1 CARD FROM ITS RELATED POOL, REFERENCE THE ETERNAVA TCG™].

Generation 4: (Unsigned, 99.9% Sealed); World Fun Facts Expansion, Author AMAs per volume, Fate (in-system currency). [COMES WITH 1 CARD FROM ITS RELATED POOL, REFERENCE THE ETERNAVA TCG™].

Generation 5: (Unsigned, 100% Sealed); Basic manga format. [COMES WITH 1 CARD FROM ITS RELATED POOL, REFERENCE THE ETERNAVA TCG™].

Each Generation, as mentioned previously, has a limited print run based solely on the current demand for the last batch. Generally speaking, the public won’t have access to Sovereign, Collector’s and Limited Editions, but once a product goes through its print it runs out of print forever, and printing less than demand always expands the demand behind it, evolution through selection— but into abundance. It is important to stress that once Generation 5 runs, this is NOT mass produced. Instead there will be no physical copies ever produced afterwards, further units preserved in the easily accessible digital library that Rogueborn will host for all of its works similar to Kodansha, Shuiesha and other related media companies.


— Echelon 2: 

This is the second level that elevates and enrichens the entire system, introducing the Eternava TCG™ (Trading Card Game), a digital-physical card game similar to Yugi-Oh!, yet only obtainable (physically) by buying the different generations of units within the Flagship, accompanied with the Fate currency that gives access to perks in the website/apps, lore expansions and membership upgrades.

Eternava TCG™

Overview

The Eternava Trading Card Game™ (TCG) is a next-generation competitive card game that fuses narrative depth, ecological mechanics, and strategic innovation into a living system. Unlike conventional TCGs that rely primarily on static archetypes and pre-defined metas, Eternava creates an adaptive, emergent gameplay environment where no two matches unfold identically. By integrating narrative-true mechanics, ecology systems (the Ecology System), and the Chaining Process, Eternava transforms the act of play into the experience of exploring a breathing world.

The result is a card game not only competitive and replayable but entrenched in the culture of purchasing and owning the units, because they will not be sold anywhere else. Essentially thematically and profitably inseparable from its parent narrative universe.

Core Systems —

Stats Framework:
Attack (ATK): Core offensive capability. Determines whether a unit overwhelms another on the field.
Defense (DEF): Represents the durability of physically or spiritually “one-or-nothing” or otherwise fragile units. Unlike other games, DEF is not a switchable state, but an indicator of susceptibility to one-shots unless counter mechanics are in play, as to which the value compared would instead be ATK. 
HP/Regeneration (REG): Used for higher-tier units and regenerators. For applicable units it usually replaces static DEF, making longevity a strategic axis of play.
This tri-fold system prevents stagnation. Players must balance raw aggression, conditional fragility, and long-term sustain.

Soul Anchors & Invocation Seals: 
Soul Anchors: Represent the player’s durability. In the beginning, onboarding phase of the game, players start with 3 Soul Anchors, each representing 1000 HP, and others cannot be broken until the first is broken, preventing roll-over damage and one-shot attacks. Additionally, each Soul Anchor broken allows the player a buff, for example, the first Soul Anchor broken allows one to summon any card in the “Afterworld” or “Invocation Deck”, using the broken Anchor as a tribute, the second granting two extra chaining potentials and/or double drawing potential.


Invocation Seals: Represent the player limit to units in their deck. The limit for the base tier of playing is 40 Invocation Seals, while higher layers of playing allow 60, 80, then 100 if regarding the highest layers. Some units, such as those above Ultimate (see tiering system below) require multiple Invocation Seals to control. 

Mechanics:
Synergy: Units gaining buffs when paired with certain allies or in certain Invocation Archetypes / Sub-Archetypes (e.g., Hibana + Severyx, Beonce + Melo).
Terrain/Environmental Effects: Environmental modifiers, these effect stats and/or abilities, split into Normal and Special Environments which each have different effects. Confirmed ones are as follows: Scorched, Blizzard, Wet, Windbitten, Swampmudden, Stormy, Industrial, with more to come. Special ones are as follows: Voided, Starfall, Overgrowth, Crushed, Underwater, Bladed, Eldritch, with more to come.
Burst: High-risk, high-reward sacrifice moves triggered under overwhelming odds or specific triggers to prevent easy landslide wins.
Possession / Corruption: Control transfer mechanics (Spirit of Damnation, Void Cheshire Cat).
Token Systems: Shadow Tokens, Prayer Counters (Tokens), Clone Counters (Tokens), etc.
Independent Action: Special rule for Sealed Origins to act while Voided.
Blessings: Personal field-wide cards that can change the conditions of the units, the field, or buff the player. Only one can be active at a time.
Drawing & Chaining Potentials: Each player gets one drawing potential and 3 drawing potentials per turn. However there are cards, blessings, and other mechanics that can increase both of these potentials and negate or remove them. 

Board & Turn Structure:

Board: 
There are 7 Unit Slots per player (instead of 6), affecting abilities like Kurosu’s dodge count, while in the beginning the ecology board only expands this by two. There are 6 Incanta Slots as well, behind those unit slots. This evolves in phases however, to ease the onboarding process:

Beginner / Low Tier Play: Ecology Units (see below) act as extra summons, when you draw/invoke a spirit, it expands the board to 9 slots instead of 7. Spirits are docile → they don’t act independently, no backfire, no predator/prey. They function like low-tier supports or fragile invocations.

Mid Tier Play: The Ecology Board (see below) is introduced, a separate field placed above the 7 unit slots, spanning 5 slots. Spirits go into the ecology board instead of the main board. They interact with your main board (buffs, curses, chaining, possession), being capable of bonding with certain units and providing various buffs.

High Tier / Competitive Play: We introduce Dual Ecology Interaction (see below), where both players’ Ecology boards now interact with eachother, predator/prey logic between cross-universe archetypes, chaining, devouring across fields, cross-possession, and more. At this point, two games are being played at once, the Main Board duel and the Spirit Ecology duel.
Additionally there are no “Defense Position”—units are always active; attacks target’s DEF or HP/REG unless it is a counter unit or it is countered by a counterspell. Attack Resolution follows direct ATK vs DEF/HP comparison with recoil/damage spillover where applicable.

Turn Flow: 
In between every phase there is a Backlash Phase, where effects from the opponent’s cards or the player’s cards can trigger if need be.
Draw Phase – The player draws one card from their deck, unless it is the first turn of the first player, where they exorcise their drawing potentials unless otherwise negated.
Backlash Phase – 
Main Phase 1 – This is the phase where the player is allowed to invoke units or utilize up to three of their chaining potentials that turn unless otherwise negated. One normal invocation and one special invocation is allowed per turn, unless the potential for this is otherwise increased or negated.
Backlash Phase –
Battle Phase – If chosen, the player can declare attacks with their invoked units.
Backlash Phase –
Main Phase 2 – Similar to Main Phase 1 but if the potentials were performed already in Main Phase 1, they cannot be reused unless stated otherwise, as certain units ignore this.
Backlash Phase –
End Phase – The turn player can activate or resolve any effects, and then their turn ends and the next player’s turn begins.

Deck Archetypes —
Generally restricted to universe-based archetypes, for example Kizamari would be Spiritual Archetype, while beings from the World of Ties would be Horror Archetype, yet there are a plethora of sub-archetypes that allow cross universe pairings to be favorable and even advantageous than running strictly universe specific (though rewarding) Invocation Decks.


Tiering System —

Eternava uses an ascending rarity/tier system that determines the range of stat values and deck-building constraints:

Rare: 0-800 ATK, 0-800 DEF / 0-800 HP; 0-1600 stat ceiling. 
Epic: 700-1400 ATK, 0-1400 DEF / 0-1400 HP; 1400–2800 stat ceiling.
Legendary: 1150-2500 ATK, 1150-2500 DEF / 1150-2500 HP; 2300–5000 stat ceiling.
Mythic: 2500-5000 ATK, 2500-5000 DEF / 2500-5000 HP; 5000-10000 stat ceiling.
Celestial: 5000-10,000 ATK, 5000-10000 DEF / 5000-10000 HP; 10,000-20,000 stat ceiling.
Exotic: 10,000-25,000 ATK, 10,000-25,000 DEF / 10,000- 25,000 HP; 20,000-50,000 stat ceiling.
Ultimate: 25,000-35,000 ATK, 25,000-35,000 DEF / 25,000-35,000 HP; 50,000-70,000 stat ceiling.
Divine: 30,000-45,000 ATK, 30,000-45,000 DEF / 30,000-45,000 HP; 60,000-90,000 stat ceiling.
Eternal: 35,000-50,000 ATK, 35,000-50,000 DEF / 35,000-50,000 HP; 70,000-100,000 stat ceiling.

For low tier play, only legendary, epic and rare will be allowed, max one mythic per deck. Mid tier play allows much more mythics, still capped, while opening the door to limited Celestials and potentially Exotics. High tier play introduces some of the highest tiers of rarity. The current focus is Rare → Mythic. Epics form the backbone of most decks. Legendaries require Epic tributes, while Mythics serve as centerpiece bosses. Higher tiers will be released in expansions, unlocking cosmic-level interactions. Unlike other TCGs, tier ceilings in Eternava are narrative-bound—a Mythic does not simply represent “rarity,” but metaphysical scale.

Crown Jewels of the Eternava TCG™ —

Ecology Layer:
The ecology layer isn’t just another board or gimmick that Eternava represents, it is in this mini-section for a reason. It transforms the game from standard “combat math” into a living simulation of Eternava’s spirit ecology. Unlike other TCGs where summons are “extra pieces,” the Ecology Layer expands the board dynamically, introduces predator/prey logic, and evolves through the play tiers, acting as the main hub of chaining (see below), bonding, and fusion mechanics. The onboarding process is explained above, but as for a refresher:

The first stage expands the main unit slots by +2 (9 instead of 7), spirits are docile and they serve as supports and fragile invocations. 

The second stage introduces the dedicated ecology board, 5 slots above the main 7-unit board, and ecology spirits occupy this space instead of main unit slots, these spirits can buff, curse, chain, possess or provide synergy to main board units, backfire begins here, refuse, curse or rebel if misplayed, and now the ecology board acts as a second axis of play with autonomy. Spirits have limited agency, buffs, curses.

The final stage includes dual ecology interaction— the players’ ecology board interacts with one another, and predator-prey logic applies cross-field. Spirits have full ecology behaviors (prey, predation, possession, rebellion).

Chaining:
Fundamentally speaking, Chaining could be considered the first crown jewel of this TCG, and it certainly deserves this. It, at its core, represents the bonds and contracts between the ecology layer and the main board, as well as accepted restrictions in order for proportionate additions. It works as a fusion mechanic (unit + unit with conditions, unit + spirit), a buff mechanic (granting traits, affinities, stats), a risk mechanic (restrictions, drawbacks, sacrificial clauses). The core rules of chaining are as follows:

Chaining Potential: 
Each player has 3 Chaining Potentials per turn by default, representing “opportunities” to create or activate chains. Potentials can be expanded by card effects (Alejandro’s Sleepwalking), Soul Anchor breaks (2nd Anchor = +2 potentials), Blessings, Invocation Effects, and Incanta Effects.

Conditions For Chaining:
Chains are graded by Affinity between units/spirits. Low Affinity grants weak buffs, small traits (piercing, sluggish, minor stat boosts), High Affinity unlocks special transformations, or “Bonding”. Examples:
Nefersa + Nefertiti → High Affinity Synergy (the cat can come in and out of the board).
Fyodor + Serpent of Despair → Bonded control.

Affinity ensures deckbuilding depth, allowing awkward synergies for utility and natural affinities to unlock peak combos. However the real magic lies in delayed effects, which allow chains to be stacked throughout turns and set up for final boss level cards.

Chain Outcomes:
Chaining can result in several different outcome types
Buff Chains: Adds traits like Piercing, Bleeding, Windbitten, Sluggish, etc.
Fusion Chains: Creates a new form/unit entirely (Alejandro + Post-Apocalyptic Spirit = Postal).
Possession Chains: Spirit takes over unit, unlocking unique effects (Spirit of Damnation, Void Cheshire Cat).
Bonding Chains (Shikigami System): Spirit(s) become permanent extensions of the conduit unit. Strongest but riskiest, because if conduit dies, all bonded spirits vanish.
Sacrificial Chains: Destroy one unit to unlock chained effect (common for Mythic/Celestial tier).

Fundamental/Universal Chains:
There are a few allowed universal chains, for example;
Strength Enchain; Allows the user to abandon card effects to increase their attack and defense proportionate to the card’s effects, for something that does not have anything significantly beneficial, or depending on card rarity the player doesn't get anything.
Death Gambit; You cannot attack for the next three turns, restore a Soul Anchor OR increase one unit’s attack by 1000 if a unit was not destroyed in that time. Only natural DEF/REG is counted, artificial buffs are negated.
Sacrificial Enchain; Sacrifice a card, depending on the rarity, different effects occur. Not set in stone yet.

Case Examples of Chaining:

Alejandro + Post-Apocalyptic Spirit
Trigger: Requires 3 turns of waiting (restriction).
Chain Result: Postal — 1800 ATK, dodge mechanic, bullet rain, deterioration clause.
Strategic Impact: Reward for patience. Weak rare Alejandro → High Epic Postal.
Fyodor + Serpent of Despair:
Trigger: High Affinity Chain, serpent bonded as Shikigami.
Chain Result: Spirit becomes battlefield weapon under Fyodor’s control.
Strategic Impact: Example of Bonding Chain – risk of conduit death equates to total erasure.
Hibana + Severyx
Trigger: Special synergy condition, requires both Hibana and a Covert Union unit.
Chain Result: Summons Severyx (destroys two Union units).
Strategic Impact: Example of sacrificial high affinity chain. Extremely powerful but punishes poor timing.

Balancing:
Chaining is extremely powerful, so balance is controlled by the limits on chaining potentials per turn (3), restrictions on certain chain types, affinity scaling, sacrificial clauses, conduit weakness. These all prevent the infinite combo metas some TCGs suffer from, while still keeping it intensely rewarding.

Character/Unit Examples —

Unit: Hibana Zessuru 
ATK: 900 REG/HP:1000 
Seiryoku Mechanics: This unit can attack twice per turn if there is a spirit on board. If attacking a spirit first this card does 3x the damage. If no spirits on the field nor any regen units, Hibana buffs all teammates by 20% and heals 10% of their HP if applicable. Cannot destroy units. If paired with Severyx, ATK doubles and REG triples. 

Unit: Zekaito (Eto) 
ATK: 1200 (can be amped due to various effects) DEF: 3500 
Eldritch Mechanics: Once per turn, Zekaito can use Voodoo to empower himself. This can inflict the “Unreality” Trait and can make his attacks inflict piercing, attack twice, or make opponents attacks miss. 
Once used, that effect is locked, until all others are used then the cycle resets. Mordecai Synergy; find a “Mordecai Influence” in the deck, and attach it to Zekaito, once applied, turn DEF to HP/REG. If destroyed while attached, HP/REG naturally regenerates, cannot be resurrected by any card. If Province card is in hand, deploy it during enemies card, two cards on field are “Rewritten” and are on your side of the field. 
This card also attacks allies once every other turn, destroying them instantly. 

Unit: Severyx (Sealed Origin) 
ATK: 2100 DEF: 0 
This card cannot be damaged or destroyed by normal means. If paired with Hibana, his ATK increases by 3x, but he can only attack once every three turns. Severance; if first two attacks are ineffective, third attack instantly destroys the card. That card cannot be resurrected nor be utilized in Chaining or Contracts. If Hibana is destroyed, destroy this card as well. Sealing is effective. Anomalous Origin; attack all opponent cards at 10% reduced damage per card. This is a piercing attack. Can be used at any time.
 
Unit: Soteru (Destructive) 
ATK: 0 DEF: 0 REG (NOT HP): 500 
Once played, this card gains atk and def based on how many empty spaces there are on the field, 500 per slot with Haisure, 300 alone. (Note: Haisure’s trait allows him to flip this effect so he gains attack.) 
This card stays on the field after death so long he has not found Eureka (Haisure). Destructive Authorship; every other turn, flip a coin. If tails, destroy a card on the enemy field. 
Finding Haisure; once per turn, flip three cards from bottom OR top of the deck to the graveyard unless Haisure is found. If in the hand, special summon. This card is now “Soteru (Fortuna)” and can now be attacked and destroyed conventionally. It keeps the REGEN it gained per turn. 
Reality Rewrite; Soteru (Fortuna) can now change the terrain to apply whatever stat effect, if dead, this becomes a synergy card and shields the rest of the team. 

Unit: Nefersa (S1) 
ATK: 800 DEF: 1200 
Blindfolded Fool; Every turn, switch ATK and DEF as Nefersa puts her blindfold on. 
Two of Wands; If Nefertiti is on the field, switch positions and land either a piercing attack or have Nefertiti tank the damage. 
(Locked) Major Arcana Tower; If all cards are present on the enemy field, halve their attack and defense for five turns. 

Unit: Polyphia (Chimera) 
ATK: 300(+) DEF: 100(+) HP/REG: 1000 
Horror Mechanics: 
Tungsten Body; To damage this creature, you have to overcome his defense to hurt him (100+ however much damage). 
Devour; Devour every destroyed card in your graveyard. For each card gain 150 in ATK and 50 in DEF. For every Horror devoured, gain their buff, cycle through once per turn as you will, once used, cannot be used again until the cycle resets. Once cycle completes, he deals 10x base piercing damage to any target. If more than five cards devoured, deal 5x instead of 10x. 
(Locked) Violence; if returned from the graveyard, use this ability. Any card that attacks this card is now under its control for one turn, additionally, it can only once destroy one unit on the opposite end or controlled. After under control, the effect no longer applies to it.

The Eternava TCG is not merely a game—it is a simulation of a living world. Its two crown jewels, Ecology and Chaining, redefine the trading card genre by introducing autonomy, restriction-based fusion, and emergent meta ecology. Its card designs translate lore into mechanics with unusual precision, ensuring narrative integrity and competitive excitement coexist.
Replayability is unprecedented. Competitive potential is immense. The design philosophy allows weak decks to thrive, strong decks to be countered, and no meta to calcify.
In full, Eternava TCG is the most thematically faithful, strategically dynamic, and narratively embedded trading card game ever designed. It is not just a card game—it is Eternava itself, alive on the tabletop.

Indi-Seller Logos™

Overview

Basic Description & Analysis: We observe within this particular the systematic erasure of the need for traditional outreach, standard bookselling & front-end distribution chains. By expounding; yet not depending on the success of the World Rollout Strategem, the Indi-Seller Logos provides a mulplicative factor by the tapering of the trading dynamic— through the Generational Trading System forcing items out of print, each item generates an enormous amount of value. We then provide a license to resellers to legally sell and profit multiple times from one resell on their part. 

Detail: 
Essentially, in our Induced Decay Model, each reseller gets a 5% cut from the next three transfers while Rogueborn gets a 15% immortality tithe (10% to the author, 5% to Rogueborn) and no backend costs while the cuts cannot exceed 30%. To give the clearest example: 
Resell 1: 15% (Rogueborn Immortality Tithe [RIT]) 
Resell 2: 20% (RIT, Reseller 1 [R1]) 
Resell 3: 25% (RIT, R1, R2) 
Resell 4: 30% (RIT, R1, R2, R3) 
Resell 5: 30% (RIT, R2, R3, R4) 
Resell 6: 30% (RIT, R3, R4, R5) 
Resell 7: 30% (RIT, R4, R5, R6) … ad infinitum.  

Now while this system is amazing I did come across one issue. What if people didn’t want to do this, essentially what if they wanted it to pass hands without necessarily buying or selling anything. This necessitates the Gifting Option where the perks immediately transfer (with the set time frame of the perks being active) from one account to the other, this means if it came with a membership but there’s only three days left then you only get the three days left. If the in website currency (Fate) was spent before the transfer then you simply don’t get it, and it allows for the physical passing of units without depreciation or contention points in the system. Then there are additional issues, like what if it is undersold? This could possibly open up the strategy structure for Ponzi schemers to snipe at the weak spots in the IDM. However, proposed attempts to fix this issue actually just create a bigger gap for them to capitalize, here it is an incentive that still pays the author and Rogueborn, and resellers.

Kizamari Chronicles: Spiritual Outbreak

Purpose: 
This game, designed originally to be hosted on Roblox, is fashioned to be a playable chapter to draw intrigue into Kizamari. By leveraging the most played game in the world and creating a high-quality, highly original game in it, we effectively become the number one game without any of the backend cost. Additionally, through DevShare, the robux earned back through emots, skin, playtime, and cosmetics would easily pay back the planned $66,000 investment.

Detail:

The core of the game’s mechanics are as follows.
There are 4 playable cities, Leoria (capital of the New World), Valun (Al-Ghul), Megaro, and Holari (Versailles Estate), in an open world map similar to Shindo Life II’s, taversable through the railway system. Each city has 4 districts, each with a differing chance to spawn/cause Outbreaks, where malicious/corrupted spirits break out and attack civilians. Level of monsters is generally based on the range of total players (of applicable level) in the district.


Generational Distribution System Implementation (GDS)
0) Ground rules (harsh & real)
Scarcity only works if you enforce it in code and contracts. If transfers can happen off-platform without consequence, your resale economics die. So: entitlements live in your ledger; the physical book is a souvenir unless it’s paired to a valid ledger entry.


“Print less than demand” is a discipline, not a vibe. It requires a demand model, deposits, and a hard cutoff you never violate—even when your Discord screams.


“Indi-Seller Logos” skate near “pyramid-y” optics if you market “profit from resales.” Don’t. Structure it as a pedigreed collector’s license with rolling referral royalty and hammer utility (perks, access, culture), not “investment.”


Fate is a loyalty license, not money. Keep it non-redeemable for cash and non-transferable peer-to-peer, or you walk into money-transmitter hell.


1) System architecture at a glance
You can do this as Web2 (centralized ledger) or Web3 (on-chain). My recommendation: Web2 first (you need velocity, UX control, and freedom to iterate), with a clean boundary layer to mint optional NFTs (“digital markers”) later.
Core services:
Catalog & Editions — defines Sovereign/Collector/Limited/Gen1-5 SKUs and their perk sets.


Ownership Ledger — single source of truth for “who owns which unit” + the rolling 3-transfer royalty queue.


Entitlement Engine — turns ownership into perks (AMAs, memberships, Fate, digital art, TCG redemption).


Transfer/Marketplace — primary sales, secondary sales, and gifting, all through the same API so the ledger stays clean.


Royalty Splitter — computes RIT 15% (10% author/5% Rogueborn) + 5% to each of the last three eligible resellers, capped at 30% total.


Anti-Fraud — KYC, cooldowns, minimum-consideration floors, bot guard, wash-sale detector.


Demand & Print-Run Planner — deposits + waitlist + price-sensitivity + lead times → quantity for each drop (always < demand).


Physical-Digital Bridge — per-unit UID via QR + short code (and optionally NFC); server-side claim flow binds the physical to an account once.

3) Transfer & royalty algorithm (the “rolling three”)
Policy:
On every paid secondary sale, pay:


15% RIT → split 10% author, 5% Rogueborn.


Up to 3× 5% to prior eligible resellers (those in the queue with remaining_transfers > 0).


Cap total cuts at 30%. If there are fewer than 3 eligible resellers, total fees < 30%.


On gifts: no money moves, but ownership and entitlements transfer (subject to time remaining), and the queue does not decrement (to prevent griefing by burning someone’s three rewards with zero-value passes).


On primary sale: no reseller rewards (queue empty); after ownership settles, insert seller (Rogueborn itself) into queue? No. Only secondary sellers enter the queue. The seller of a secondary sale is the one added with remaining_transfers = 3.


Pseudocode:
def transfer_unit(unit_id, seller, buyer, kind, gross_cents):
    assert kind in ('secondary_sale','gift','primary_sale')
    now = utcnow()

    # anti-fraud checks
    enforce_cooldown(unit_id, seller, now)
    if kind == 'secondary_sale':
        enforce_consideration_floor(unit_id, gross_cents)

    # compute royalties
    splits = []
    fees_cents = 0
    if kind == 'secondary_sale':
        # 15% RIT
        rit = round(gross_cents * 0.15)
        splits += [{'payee':'author', 'cents': round(gross_cents * 0.10)},
                   {'payee':'rogueborn','cents': round(gross_cents * 0.05)}]
        fees_cents += rit

        # up to 3×5% to eligible resellers
        # order: most recent first
        q = get_queue(unit_id)[:3]
        for entry in q:
            if entry.remaining_transfers > 0:
                cut = round(gross_cents * 0.05)
                splits.append({'payee': entry.user_id, 'cents': cut})
                fees_cents += cut
                entry.remaining_transfers -= 1
                save(entry)

        # cap at 30%
        fee_cap = round(gross_cents * 0.30)
        if fees_cents > fee_cap:
            scale = fee_cap / fees_cents
            for s in splits: s['cents'] = int(s['cents'] * scale)
            fees_cents = fee_cap

        # add this seller to the front of the queue with 3 future rewards
        upsert_queue_head(unit_id, seller, remaining_transfers=3)

    # record transfer
    create_transfer(unit_id, from=seller, to=buyer, kind=kind,
                    gross_cents=gross_cents if kind!='gift' else 0,
                    fees_cents=fees_cents, royalties_json=splits)

    # move ownership
    set_owner(unit_id, buyer)

    # entitlements
    apply_entitlement_transfer(unit_id, from_user=seller, to_user=buyer, kind=kind)

Entitlement transfer rules (map to your spec):
Membership days → transfer remaining days; clock does not reset.


Fate (points) → remaining balance transfers; spent points do not resurrect.


One-time digital items (e.g., exclusive art) → transfer access only if not previously downloaded? Be explicit: either allow perpetual cloud access to prior owner and current (risk of duplication) or require “exclusive access owner = current owner” (cleaner).


TCG pack-in: if physical card is inside the box, that’s physical. If digital redemption is included, bind 1× redemption to the unit; if seller redeemed already, buyer sees it as redeemed (fits your scarcity).


4) “Sealed vs Unsealed” → enforceable product states
Map your edition adjectives to tangible gating:
Unsealed = rich entitlements on claim (AMA, guidebooks, higher Fate, membership, digital art, extra TCG redemption).


Sealed (percentage) = ratio controlling how many of the “full perk set” are active (e.g., Gen1 90% Sealed → only some perks; Gen5 100% Sealed → no digital perks beyond bare minimum). Represent this as a perk whitelist per edition in editions.perks.


Physically: print on the colophon page the edition name + drop code + public UID. Include a tamper-evident scratch strip over the short claim code.


5) Physical production & fulfillment (how to actually do drops)
Print method:
Sovereign/Collector/Limited → offset (quality, cost per unit low, high setup cost), small runs (hundreds to a few thousand).


Gens 1–5 → mixed: Gen1–2 offset; Gen3–5 can be high-end POD with pre-bound inserts for flexibility if needed.


Color: Sovereign full color; Collector partial; Limited partial; Gens degrade per your spec. Lock this in each edition’s color_profile.


Kitting:
Each unit gets shrink-wrap, QR sticker (outside), claim card (inside), TCG pack-in (inside), and—if Sovereign/Collector—signature plate.


Use a pick/pack manifest keyed by units.public_uid so the warehouse can scan the UID into the shipping label → you know which serial went where.


Anti-bot & scalper control:
Queue with account-age, KYC light, per-household limits, velocity checks.


Deposits (refundable) to join a drop’s allocation.


Primary sale windows that prefer allowlist (community status, creator support proof) before public.


6) Demand & print-run sizing (so you actually “sell less than demand”)
Every drop runs a two-stage signal:


RSVP (free) → gets you a top-of-funnel number per edition/region.


Deposit window ($5–$20, fully applied to purchase) → that’s your real demand.


Set planned_qty = floor(deposit_count × scarcity_factor), with scarcity_factor between 0.6 and 0.9 depending on how aggressive you want to be.


Never reprint a retired drop code. If you must reissue content, it’s a new generation by definition.


Publish a post-mortem each drop: deposits, minted, sell-through, secondary price trajectory. This transparency fuels the collector culture without promissory investment language.


7) Marketplace flows (primary, secondary, gifting)
Primary:
Checkout attaches the exact unit (you can assign serials at ship time, but the order must resolve to a unit ID before it leaves the warehouse). Ownership starts as “pending” until the buyer claims (by scanning the QR + claim code). If they never claim, the unit is still theirs—but perks stay locked.


Secondary:
Only units claimed into an account can be listed. Payouts go to connected rails (Stripe Connect/Plaid).


Pricing: let sellers set price; you enforce minimum consideration floor: min_price = max( floor(0.5× last_sale_price), hard_floor_by_edition ). This kills the “$1 pass to alt account” exploit without playing whack-a-mole.


When a sale clears, run transfer_unit(kind='secondary_sale') (algorithm above), then ship either P2P (with tracked shipping and buyer protection escrows), or custodial (you offer an optional escrow warehouse service to authenticate and ship).


Gifting:
Flow exactly like a sale but kind='gift', gross=0, no royalty payouts, no queue decrement.


Anti-abuse: cooldown per unit (e.g., one transfer per 7 days) applies to gifts too; KYC required.


8) Anti-fraud & gaming controls
Cooldowns: min_days_between_transfers = 7 (configurable by edition; tighter on Sovereign).


Consideration floor (above).


Wash-sale detector: if a unit boomerangs among a small cluster of accounts repeatedly → flag, require manual review, or temporarily block the accounts from that unit.


Velocity limits: caps on number of purchases/transfers per month per user.


Geo/KYC: light KYC for secondary market payouts; IP/device fingerprinting to stop mass sockpuppets.


Queue integrity: only paid secondary sellers are added to reseller_queue with 3 future rewards; gifts and primary sales do not.


9) Perk clock & transfer logic (the tricky user-experience part)
Implement entitlement types:
membership_days: on claim, start a clock (e.g., 365 days); on transfer, remaining days move to the new owner.


fate_points: integer balance in the perk record; transfers move remaining balance; points are non-cash, non-P2P, expire if account dormant (e.g., 24 months).


digital_art_bundle: either “exclusive to current owner” (clean) or “permanently unlocked for anyone who ever owned” (messy but nice). Pick one and state it in the Edition card.


tcg_pack_redemption: redeemed=false until used; once redeemed, it stays redeemed across transfers.


10) TCG pack-in logistics (so the game fuels the book)
Each edition points to a card pool (e.g., Sovereign pool has higher mythic odds; Gen5 pool is commons/rares).


In editions.perks, set tcg_pack_count and pool_id.


Physical fulfilment: pack the card(s) in-box, AND/OR give a digital redemption in the entitlement (good for Arena-style online play later).


If you do digital, implement a server-side RNG that pulls cards from the pool with published odds; store yield in tcg_redemptions.yield_json.


11) Pricing & P/L (don’t guess; pre-wire it)
Sovereign/Collector/Limited: premium MSRP with margin ≥ 60% after unit COGS (paper, print, kitting, shipping subsidy, fees). You will need that margin to fund community ops and inevitable errors.


Gens 1–5: step down MSRP per your sealing. Still include 1 TCG card; that’s your “always a reason to buy physical” hook.


Secondary market fee cap (30%) is generous; expect average realized ~20–25%. Be explicit in UI where it goes (author/you/resellers) to build goodwill.


12) Legal & policy (so no one nukes you)
Terms of Sale / License: the physical book confers a revocable, limited, personal license to the entitlements bound to the ledger entry, transferable only via the platform. Off-platform resale = you keep the paper, but lose entitlements (nobody will do it).


Royalty framing: “rolling referral royalty on future platform transfers” — not returns; never call it investment or promise appreciation.


Fate: “promotional loyalty points,” no cash value, no withdrawal, no exchange outside the platform.


Resale compliance: you’re taking a platform fee + license royalty, not brokering securities. Use Stripe Connect/Adyen MarketPay with KYC for payouts.


Consumer law: disclose odds for any digital TCG redemption (loot-like), regional age gates where applicable.


Signatures: Sovereign signed copies → authenticate with serialized signature plates logged per units.id.


Privacy: transfer history is visible to the owner and to admin; optional “public pedigree” page for clout.


13) MVP roadmap (90 days, brutal & real)
Weeks 1–2 — Contracts & SKU truth
Finalize edition matrices (perks JSON), transfer policy, queue semantics, anti-fraud rules.


Printer RFP; pick one offset house + one POD partner; define kitting bill of materials.


Weeks 3–6 — Build v1 Platform
Ship Catalog, Ownership Ledger, Entitlement Engine, Transfer API, and a basic marketplace.


Claim flow with QR + scratch code.


Admin console for drops, allocations, and royalty logs.


Stripe Connect live; KYC flows.


Unit tests for the queue math and cap logic.


Weeks 7–8 — Demand & Drop 0 (small)
Run RSVP + deposit for Limited pilot (e.g., 500–1,000 units).


Lock planned_qty, print, kit, and ship.


Watch claim rates, first resales, gifting edge cases.


Weeks 9–10 — Sovereign micro-drop
100–300 units, high touch. Validate signing workflow, signature plate serialization, AMA perk delivery.


TCG redemption v1 (even if just a static pack-in code list).


Weeks 11–12 — Harden
Anti-bot, cooldown, wash-sale, consideration floor tuning.


Add gift flow UI and support macros.


Publish transparent post-drop report.


14) What can break (and how to not get wrecked)
Scalpers: without allowlists and deposit windows, your early drops will be botted. Solve at the gate.


Wash sales: without a consideration floor, the queue can be farmed. Keep the floor.


Support load: lost scratch codes, shipping damage, claim disputes—budget and staff for this before you scale.


Printer slippage: your scarcity and hype die if you miss ship windows. Choose partners with slack, and lock slots.


Legal tone: do not say “profit from resales.” Say “collectible license with built-in creator & reseller rewards.”


Community optics: publish fee splits and creator payouts; fans will defend you if you’re transparent.

16) Answers to your explicit edge cases
Gifting without sale: supported; perks & ownership transfer, no royalties, no queue decrement, cooldown applies.


Undersold transfers / ponzi sniping: the consideration floor makes “$1 pass” non-qualifying; also only transfers meeting the floor add the seller to the queue as R1/R2/R3. (If you intentionally keep “any price counts,” you invite collapse. Don’t.)


Off-platform resale: allowed physically, but entitlements don’t move without on-platform transfer, so buyers won’t do it.


Expired perks: timers carry forward; no reset. Fate spent stays spent.


Unclaimed units: the buyer owns the paper; entitlements stay locked until claimed—this encourages claiming without making you the police.

Enforcement Protocol Maxim (Schedule J)

Purpose:
To establish the enforcement, penalty, and protective mechanisms governing infringement of Rogueborn’s proprietary systems, trademarks, and publishing protocols. Beyond financial compensation, infringement will trigger corrective cultural consequences designed to reaffirm Rogueborn’s sovereignty and elevate its public legitimacy.

Section 1: Infringement Definition
Unauthorized use of Rogueborn’s proprietary terms: Generational Distribution System™, Indi-Seller Logos™, Sigil Decay Protocol™, Rogueborn™.


Unauthorized replication of the royalty-tracked resale system, including but not limited to: structured resale royalties to author/publisher/resellers, edition-tier degradation models, or semi-fungible publishing perks.


Operation of a publishing or distribution ecosystem materially identical to Rogueborn’s architecture without licensing, partnership, or authorization.

(Includes unauthorized use of GDS™, ISL™, SDP™, Rogueborn™, or replication of royalty-tracked resale systems with or without knowledge.)

Section 2: Offendent Rights
Option A – Mandatory Surrender & Oversight


Any infringing party found replicating or unlawfully deploying Rogueborn’s systems shall, in lieu of dismantlement, surrender thirty-five percent (35%) ownership interest of the infringing branch or operation.


Rogueborn shall be vested with full operational oversight rights, including:


Final Say Authority on major strategic, financial, and administrative decisions of the infringing branch.


Dismantlement Right, which may be exercised at any time, with or without cause, upon determination by Rogueborn that said branch violates the spirit, letter, or trust of this Agreement.


Innovation Appropriation: any system, process, or derivative developed under the infringing branch is deemed property of Rogueborn and may be freely adopted into its ecosystem.


In addition, the infringing party must issue a formal public apology and a public partnership acknowledgment, clearly stating Rogueborn’s priority ownership of the system.


Option B – Mandatory Dismantlement & Damages
If Option A is refused, Rogueborn shall initiate immediate dismantlement of the infringing branch or operation, including court-ordered shutdown of all derivative products and services.


The infringing party shall pay:


Treble damages (3x proven damages)


Full legal fees


The infringing party shall also be compelled to issue a formal public apology acknowledging Rogueborn’s priority rights and explicitly admitting to infringement.


Non-Negotiability of Options
No middle ground exists between Option A and Option B. Any attempt to negotiate outside these parameters shall be deemed refusal of Option A, and Option B will be automatically triggered.


Violation of the above results in retroactive restructuring of said operational branch under my [Sincere Wilson’s] proprietary governance, in perpetuity, subject to my sole discretion of disbandment, restructuring, or absorption. No entity, person, or system shall possess autonomous claim upon the original framework without this licensing clause’s written permission. This claim is irrevocable. This clause survives assignment, sale, acquisition, restructuring, bankruptcy, merger, or transfer of said entity, and shall attach to any future instantiations or derivative operations arising from the core model, system, or identifiable trade dress.



Section 3: Mandatory Public Apology Clause
All infringers shall, as part of settlement or judgment, publish a public statement meeting the following requirements:
Medium: Must be published on the infringer’s official website, press release channels, and at least one major news distribution service (e.g. PR Newswire).


Language: Must explicitly name “Rogueborn,” “Generational Distribution System,” “Indi-Seller Logos” and “Sigil Decay Protocol” as original creations of Sincere Imani Wilson, with recognition of prior ownership.


Tone: Must include an apology for unauthorized use and acknowledgment of Rogueborn as the innovator of the system.


Duration: Must remain accessible for a minimum of 12 consecutive months in the public domain.


Optional Clause (Deterrent): Failure to issue apology within the timeframe constitutes grounds for doubled damages and immediate injunction.


Sample Language (to be adapted for each infringement):
“We, [Company Name], acknowledge that our use of royalty-tracked resale and generational publishing systems improperly infringed on the proprietary intellectual property of Sincere Imani Wilson and Rogueborn. We apologize for this violation, recognize Rogueborn as the rightful originator and innovator of these systems, and commit to ceasing all unauthorized use. We thank Rogueborn for their contribution to publishing innovation.”

Section 4: Escalation & Enforcement Principle
(As before: injunctive relief, trust enforcement, or dismantling.)

Section 5: Declarative Authority
By affixing this Schedule into the Maxim Document, the undersigned establishes authority not only over financial and structural infringement but also over narrative correction in the public record.
